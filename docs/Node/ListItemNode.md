# `ListItemNode`

A `ListItemNode` consist of a marker and content.

Usually the marker and the content is separated by two spaces.
In some cases, as their might wasn't enough space cause of the 72 char limit, the space was reduced to one space.

## Marker

The marker CAN consist of multiple lines like from the [RFC9562] on line 1253:

```txt
   Replace Leftmost Random Bits with Increased Clock Precision
   (Method 3):
      For UUIDv7, which has millisecond timestamp precision, it is
      possible to use additional clock precision available on the system
      [...]
```

For sure this can only work if the marker contains text like the [Parenthesized List Item](#parenthesized-list-item), [Bracketed List Item](#bracketed-list-item) or the  [Colon List Item](#colon-list-item).

The marker MUST be one of the following types:

### Types

```txt
   -  Item 1

      a multiline text

```txt

      some content here
   Another marker  some content here and
                   and some content here
```

The content CAN also contain multiple lines, paragraphs, blank lines and more deeper lists.

```txt
   Some marker:
      some content here and here
      
      Here also content which is part of 
      the some marker
      
      And a deeper list

   Another marker here:
      some content here and here
```

The content CAN span ober multiple pages:

```txt
   code
         REQUIRED.  The authorization code generated by the
         authorization server.  The authorization code MUST expire
         shortly after it is issued to mitigate the risk of leaks.  A
         maximum authorization code lifetime of 10 minutes is
         RECOMMENDED.  The client MUST NOT use the authorization code

         more than once.  If an authorization code is used more than     <same indent as before!>
         once, the authorization server MUST deny the request and SHOULD
         revoke (when possible) all tokens previously issued based on
         that authorization code.  The authorization code is bound to
         the client identifier and redirection URI.
