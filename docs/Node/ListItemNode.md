# `ListItemNode`

A `ListItemNode` represents a single item within a [`ListNode`](./ListNode.md).  Each item preserves the marker text that introduced the entry and exposes structured children describing the content.

## Shape

```ts
interface ListItemNode {
  type: 'ListItem';
  marker: string;
  markerIndent: number;
  contentIndent: number;
  children: Array<ParagraphNode | ListNode | BlankLineNode | PageHeaderNode | PageFooterNode | PageBreakNode>;
  markerOnly?: boolean;
  inline?: boolean;
}
```

The marker can be any RFC-style bullet or definition term.  It always keeps the original spacing and can span multiple lines (for example, definition terms that wrap).  The `markerIndent` property stores the number of leading spaces before the marker, while `contentIndent` records the column where content begins.

`children` is the structured representation of the item body.  Narrative paragraphs become `ParagraphNode`s, nested lists are emitted as `ListNode`s, blank separators remain `BlankLineNode`s, and pagination controls (`PageHeader`, `PageFooter`, `PageBreak`) are preserved exactly where they occurred.

The optional `markerOnly` flag is set when the original marker line contained no content and the item has no children.  When content appeared on the same line as the marker the parser sets `inline` to `true` so renderers can keep the in-line layout intact.

## Examples

### Bullet Items

```txt
   o  Response type name: token
   o  Change controller: IETF
```

Each item stores `marker = 'o'`, `markerIndent = 3`, `contentIndent = 6`, and a single `ParagraphNode` child containing the description.

### Definition Terms

```txt
   resource owner
      An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.
```

The marker captures `"resource owner"`, `markerIndent = 3`, and `contentIndent = 6`.  The definition body becomes one or more `ParagraphNode`s; additional blank lines or nested lists would appear in `children` preserving their original order.

### Multi-page Items

```txt

         REQUIRED.  The authorization code generated by the
         authorization server.

```

The parser emits `PageFooter`, `PageBreak`, and `PageHeader` nodes inside `children` so a renderer can reproduce the exact pagination boundaries when round-tripping the document.
